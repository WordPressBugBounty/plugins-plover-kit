== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Does Plover Kit work with any WordPress theme? =

Yes. Plover Kit is built for the block editor (Gutenberg) and works with any modern WordPress theme that supports blocks, including classic themes with the block editor enabled. For the best experience, we recommend using a block theme like [Plover Themes](https://wpplover.com/themes/), Twenty Twenty-Four, or any other FSE-compatible theme.

= Will Plover Kit slow down my website? =

No. Plover Kit follows a modular design – you only enable the modules you actually need. Unused modules are completely disabled and do not load any code on your site. This ensures optimal performance and minimal impact on page speed.

= Do I need coding skills to use Plover Kit? =

No coding required. All features are designed to be used directly within the WordPress block editor – no shortcodes, no custom PHP, no editing theme files. You can add icons, animations, layout controls, and more with just a few clicks.

Plover Kit is specifically designed for the WordPress block editor (Gutenberg). While it may coexist with other page builders, its features are only available when editing with blocks. We recommend using it with block-based themes and workflows.
